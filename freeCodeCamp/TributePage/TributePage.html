        <p><strong>Diego Armando Maradona</strong> born in 30 October 1960 died at the age of 60 in 25 November 2020)
            was an Argentine professional football player and manager.
            Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, he was one of the two joint winners of the FIFA
            Player of the 20th Century award. Maradona's vision, passing, ball control, and dribbling skills were
            combined with his small stature (1.65 metres (5 ft 5 in)), which gave him a low centre of gravity allowing
            him to manoeuvre
            better than most other football players; he would often dribble past multiple opposing players on a run. His
            presence and leadership on the field had a great effect on his team's general performance, while he would
            often be singled out by the opposition. In addition to his creative abilities, he possessed an eye for goal
            and was known to be a free kick specialist.
            A precocious talent, Maradona was given the nickname "El Pibe de Oro" ("The Golden Boy"), a name that stuck
            with him throughout his career. He was also a troubled character, who was banned in both 1991 and 1994 for
            abusing drugs.

        <p id='quote'><i>'To understand the gargantuan shadow Maradona casts over his football-mad homeland, one has to
                conjure up the athleticism of Michael Jordan, the power of Babe Ruth â€“ and the human fallibility of Mike
                Tyson. Lump them together in a single
                barrel-chested man with shaggy black hair and you have El Diego, idol to the millions who call him D10S,
                a mashup of his playing number and the Spanish word for God.'</i>
